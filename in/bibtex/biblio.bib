  abstract  = {Dense sub-graphs of sparse graphs (communities), which appear in most
	real-world complex networks, play an important role in many contexts.
	Most existing community detection algorithms produce a hierarchical
	structure of communities and seek a partition into communities that
	optimizes a given quality function. We propose new methods to improve
	the results of any of these algorithms. First we show how to optimize
	a general class of additive quality functions (containing the modularity,
	the performance, and a new similarity based quality function which
	we propose) over a larger set of partitions than the classical methods.
	Moreover, we define new multi-scale quality functions which make
	it possible to detect different scales at which meaningful community
	structures appear, while classical approaches find only one partition.},

  abstract  = {Integration politics in the Netherlands has changed dramatically between 1990 and 2005. Whereas ethnic and religious differences were hitherto pacified through accommodation, a new and increasingly powerful current in Dutch politicsproblematizes the presence of minorities.This development represents a challenge to sociologists and political scientists: how to map and explain drastic changes?Arguing that extant approaches are better at explaining continuity than change, this book develops a distinct approach to the study of dynamic power relations to understand drastic transformations in the national debate as well as urban governance.},

  __markedentry = {Online social networks have become extremely popular; numerous sites allow users to interact and share content using social links. Users of these networks often establish hundreds to even thousands of social links with other users. Recently, researchers have suggested examining the activity network - a network that is based on the actual interaction between users, rather than mere friendship - to distinguish between strong and weak links. While initial studies have led to insights on how an activity network is structurally different from the social network itself, a natural and important aspect of the activity network has been disregarded: the fact that over time social links can grow stronger or weaker. In this paper, we study the evolution of activity between users in the Facebook social network to capture this notion. We find that links in the activity network tend to come and go rapidly over time, and the strength of ties exhibits a general decreasing trend of activity as the social network link ages. For example, only 30% of Facebook user pairs interact consistently from one month to the next. Interestingly, we also find that even though the links of the activity network change rapidly over time, many graph-theoretic properties of the activity network remain unchanged.},
