  abstract      = {Modularity is a fundamental feature of real networks, being intimately bounded to their functionality, i.e., to their capability of performing parallel tasks in a coordinated way. Although the modular structure of real graphs has been intensively studied, very little is known on the interactions between functional modules of a graph. Here, we present a general method based on synchronization of networking oscillators, that is able to detect overlapping structures in multimodular environments. We furthermore report the full analytical and theoretical description on the relationship between the overlapping dynamics and the underlying network topology. The method is illustrated by means of a series of applications.},

  review        = {RDF graphs are structured data that is designed to be used by computers for reasoning. However, such data may be of interest to people as well. Therefore has keyword search on RDF graphs been introduced. The current approaches to keyword search, on both RDF graphs and other graphs, typically finds solutions that connects keyword matching nodes with minimal cost. Minimal costs could, for instance, be the shortest paths between the nodes. Minimal solutions, however, may not always be the most informative answers to a query. Returning parts of the graph that constitute concepts corresponding to how humans conceptualize the world, could give answers that better satisfies the information need. This thesis has explored if such concepts can be discovered automatically in an RDF graph. To this end, we have employed algorithms for finding closely connected groups of nodes in a graph. These groups of nodes are called communities, and finding them is called community detection. A state of the art review examining approaches to keyword search on graphs in general, and RDF graphs in particular, was carried out. Additionally, we performed a review on current algorithms for finding overlapping communities in a graph. Based on this review, we did a preliminary study where the most relevant of these algorithms were applied to some RDF graphs. Through the study, we found some weaknesses in the direct application on RDF graphs, with regard to our stated objective of finding concepts. This was related to the special nature of RDF graphs, compared to other graphs. In particular, we found inconsistencies in the discovered communities with regard to class information, and the meaning that is found in predicate edges. These inconsistencies prevented us from describing the found communities as logical concepts. To eliminate these weaknesses, we developed a novel community detection algorithm for finding concepts in an RDF graph. This new algorithm defines communities in RDF graphs as a set of paths, not as a collection of nodes. We run our community detection algorithm on a sample of the nodes in the graph to find the paths included in communities, and then aggregate the results. The paths that are most frequently included in a community are kept, and used to build concepts. Our algorithm ensures that the concepts are both consistent internally in a community, and consistent across the dataset. The feasibility of our approach were shown through experiments. Furthermore, the usefulness of the approach is argued through a proof-of-concept search solution that uses the concepts found by the community detection algorithm. We find that the concepts discovered by our algorithm can enhance the answers to queries, when compared to corresponding minimal solutions.},

  abstract      = {Community detection in signed networks has been studied widely in recent years. In this paper, a discrete difference equation is proposed to imitate the consistently changing phases of the nodes. During the interaction, each node will update its phase based on the difference equation. Each node has many different nodes connected with it, and these neighbors have different influences on it. The similarity between two nodes is applied to describe the influences between them. Nodes with high positive similarities will get together and nodes with negative similarities will be far away from each other. Communities are detected ultimately when the phases of the nodes are stable. Experiments on real world and synthetic signed networks show the efficiency of detection performance. Moreover, the presented method gains better detection performance than two existing good algorithms.},

However, the community structure, which is one of the most important properties, is not well studied and modeled. In this paper, we suggest a principle called "preferential placement", which allows to model a realistic community structure. We provide an extensive empirical analysis of the obtained structure as well as some theoretical heuristics.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we develop a parallel approach for computing the modularity clustering often used to identify and analyse communities in social networks. We show that modularity can be approximated by looking at the largest eigenpairs of the weighted graph adjacency matrix that has been perturbed by a rank one update. Also, we generalize this formulation to identify multiple clusters at once. We develop a fast parallel implementation for it that takes advantage of the Lanczos eigenvalue solver and k-means algorithm on the GPU. Finally, we highlight the performance and quality of our approach versus existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract      = {In the past decade, cities have experienced rapid growth, expansion, and changes in their community structure. Many aspects of critical urban infrastructure are closely coupled with the human communities that they serve. Urban communities are composed of a multiplex of overlapping factors which can be distinguished into cultural, religious, social-economic, political, and geographical layers. In this paper, we review how increasingly available heterogeneous mobile big data sets can be leveraged to detect the community interaction structure using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. A number of community layer and interaction detection algorithms are then reviewed, with a particular focus on robustness, stability, and causality of evolving communities. The better understanding of the structural dynamics and multiplexed relationships can provide useful information to inform both urban planning policies and shape the design of socially coupled urban infrastructure systems, such as socially-driven computing and communication networks.},

In this process, we develop spectral clustering algorithms for partially oriented graphs and multi-way spectral clustering algorithms via metrics in lens spaces and complex projective spaces. As a byproduct, we give a unified viewpoint of Harary’s structural balance theory of signed graphs and the gauge invariance of magnetic potentials.},

  abstract      = {Community detection (CD) is an important task in network science. Identifying the community structure and hierarchy of communities reveals latent properties of the network. This task has real-world relevance in social network analysis, taxonomy, bioinformatics, and graph mining in general. Nevertheless, there is no common definition of a community and no common, efficient method of identifying communities. As is common, we formulate CD as optimization of modularity. Modularity quantifies the separation of a network into distinct, highly interconnected groups. Maximizing modularity is NP-hard. To solve the optimization problem, we present a polynomial-time approximation method. It greedily maximizes modularity with a heuristic for sparsest cuts in a network. This involves maximizing max-min fair throughput between all pairs of network nodes. We evaluate the approximation’s effectiveness for CD on synthetic networks with known community structure. We show competitive results in terms of the standard measure of CD accuracy, normalized mutual information (NMI). Further, our method is less sensitive to network perturbations than existing community detection algorithms. Our method also detects ties in hierarchical structure, which other techniques do not. In graphs without a strong community structure, our method does not impose arbitrary structure. In these cases, we can show that the max-min fair flow can be split onto edgedisjoint paths of a multigraph corresponding to the original network.},

  abstract      = {Brain networks are increasingly understood as one of a large class of information processing systems that share important organizational principles in common, including the property of a modular community structure. A module is topologically defined as a subset of highly inter-connected nodes which are relatively sparsely connected to nodes in other modules. In brain networks, topological modules are often made up of anatomically neighboring and/or functionally related cortical regions, and inter-modular connections tend to be relatively long distance. Moreover, brain networks and many other complex systems demonstrate the property of hierarchical modularity, or modularity on several topological scales: within each module there will be a set of sub-modules, and within each sub-module a set of sub-sub-modules, etc. There are several general advantages to modular and hierarchically modular network organization, including greater robustness, adaptivity, and evolvability of network function. In this context, we review some of the mathematical concepts available for quantitative analysis of (hierarchical) modularity in brain networks and we summarize some of the recent work investigating modularity of structural and functional brain networks derived from analysis of human neuroimaging data.},

  review        = {Community detection is an important data clustering technique for studying graph structures. Many serial algorithms have been developed and well studied in the literature. As the problem size grows, the research attention has recently been turning to parallelizing the technique. However, the conventional parallelization strategies that divide the problem domain into non-overlapping subdomains do not scale with problem size and the number of processes. The main obstacle lies in the fact that the graph algorithms often exhibit a high degree of data dependency, which makes developing scalable parallel algorithms a great challenge.
We present PMEP, a distributed-memory based parallel community detection algorithm that adopts an unconventional data partitioning strategy. PMEP divides a graph into subgraphs and assigns each pair of subgraphs to one process. This method duplicates a portion of computational workload among processes in exchange for a significantly reduced communication cost required in the later stages. After data partitioning, each process runs MEP on the assigned subgraph pair. MEP is a community detection algorithm based on the idea of maximizing equilibrium and purity. Our data partitioning method effectively simplifies the communication required for combining the local results into a global one and hence allows us to achieve better scalability over existing parallel algorithms without sacrificing the result quality. Our experimental results show a speedup of 126.95 on 190 MPI processes for using synthetic data sets and a speedup of 204.22 on 1225 processes for using a real-world data set.},

  abstract      = {In the real world, many networks show community structure, i.e., clusters of nodes, which have a high density of links within the same cluster but a lower density of links between different clusters. In this paper, nonlinearly coupled networks with community structure and non-identical nodes and with time-varying delay are considered. By applying pinning control to a fraction of network nodes, and using a suitable Lyapunov function, we obtain some new and useful synchronization criteria, which guarantee that various clusters are synchronized independently. An example is presented to show the application of the criteria obtained in this paper.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we propose a simple random network model with overlapping communities controlled by several parameters, and investigate the influence of the overlapping community structure on the synchronization behavior under different parameters. It is found that the synchronizability of the network is mainly influenced by the overlapping size of the communities and the connectivity density of the overlapped group to the other interrelated communities, and has nothing to do with the intra-connectivity of the overlapped group. In addition, it is found that the highly interconnected communities can be almost synchronized in a given time scale, whereas the overlapped group is far from synchronization. Furthermore, the instantaneous frequencies of the nodes in the communities and their overlapped group are also investigated, which show that the nodes in the overlapped group will exhibit a remarkable oscillation with a weighted mean frequency of the other correlative communities.},
