## Description
This software aims at extracting networks from bibliographic corpora. It can open Bibtex files, to get the detail of a collection of articles,
as well as Thomson ISI files, in order to get the bibliographic references contained in these articles. It matches both files and exports several networks:
* Citation networks
  * Article citation networks: nodes are articles, links are directed from the cited to the citing articles.
  * Author citation networks: nodes are authors, links are directed from the cited to the citing authors, weights are the numbers of citations.
* Coauthorship networks
	* Article coauthorship networks: nodes are articles, undirected links connect articles with common authors, weights are Jaccard's coefficient of compared authors.
	* Author coauthorship networks: nodes are authors, undirected links connect co-authors, weights are the numbers of co-authored papers.
* Cocitation networks
	* Article co-citing networks: nodes are articles, undirected links connect articles citing the same reference, weights are the numbers of co-citations.
	* Article co-cited networks: nodes are articles, undirected links connect articles cited by the same reference, weights are the numbers of co-citations.

**This software is currently in development. Don't use it (yet)!**
